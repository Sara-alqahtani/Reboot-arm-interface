# Reboot-arm-interface
بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم
To approach this user interface "I've":
1. Used the Notepad++ with all three(html,css,js), start with adding 6 Sliderrange buttons to take each engine value, the minimum value is 0 up to 180 degree for each, and closing that with adding the run button.
2. Build 2 Databases, the first one called "the_engine" as it's showen in the picture (EngineDatabase) this database include 6 columns in order to take integer value from the sliderrange buttons on page, the second database called "Runbutton" as it showen in picutre (RunbuttonDatabase) it take a boolean value or according to phpmyadmin a tinyint it's the same as boolean true will be 0 and above that is false.
